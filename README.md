# Restaurant

I want to add/edit/delete items with headless CMS strapi. So i didnt want to implement a frontend login! The customer can use the deployed UI of the headless CMS to "decorate" the page.
therefor I dont need any frontend CRUD + Auth functions. Thats the benefit of headless CMS.

If I want to implement some frontend CRUD + Auth it is better to use a self made backend or something similar
